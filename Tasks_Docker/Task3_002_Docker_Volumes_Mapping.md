# TASK 3_2: Docker Volumes Mapping

## Requirements

The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization,  
which is supposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon.  
In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task  
to create and test a docker container with certain requirements.  
Below are more details:

a. On `App Server 1` in Stratos DC pull `nginx` image (preferably `latest` tag but others should work too).  
b. Create a new container with name `news` from the image you just pulled.  
c. Map the host volume `/opt/devops` with container volume `/tmp`.  
   There is an `sample.txt` file present on same server under `/tmp`; copy that file to `/opt/devops`.  
   Also please keep the container in running state.
